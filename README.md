# Form Validation

This is a project inspired by a designed created by Mackenzie Child on his youtube channel. I like the concept and really loved how the form looked so I decided to bring it to life.
Also it was a good opportunity for me to experiment with flexbox, regular expressions and forms in Javascript.
